## 📞 Questions Answered

### **"Why these pricing rates?"**
Because you have 15+ years experience, Fortune 500 clients, and case studies showing $1.5M-$2.3M value. This justifies premium rates.

### **"What if clients think it's too expensive?"**
Wrong clients. Right clients (with real budgets) will value the expertise. The transparency filters out low-budget prospects early.

### **"Should I add more services?"**
No. These 6 are plenty. Better to be great at 6 than okay at 20.

### **"How do I book clients?"**
Portfolio + outreach. Use ACTION_PLAN_30_DAYS.md templates.

### **"What if I don't have current case studies?"**
Use the 4 provided as templates. As you get new clients, update with real wins.
